<h1> 🏠 House Price Prediction with Linear Regression</h1>

This project uses Linear Regression in Python to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, parking, warehouse, elevator, and location (address).

<h3> 🔧 Tools & Libraries</h3>

Python<br>
Pandas, NumPy<br>
Matplotlib<br>
Scikit-learn<br><br>

<h3>📊 Project Workflow</h3>
Load and clean the dataset<br>
Convert categorical features using One-Hot Encoding<br>
Split data into training and test sets<br>
Train a Linear Regression model<br>
Evaluate the model using R² score<br>
Since the dollar price in the dataset is fixed, house prices can also be converted to USD by dividing the predicted price by 30000.<br>

<h3>🎯 Goal</h3>

To practice supervised machine learning and build a simple, real-world regression model for house price prediction.
